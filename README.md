# kahoot-bot

Creates multiple bots that play (and win!) games of kahoot for you!
Uses webdriver and threading to create mutiple windows and instantly answer the questions by scraping answers from the kahoot page. The more bots you create, the slower they'll answer, so at 5 bots, each one would get an average of about 980 points per question. If you only have 1 bot, it'll get 1000 every single time :]

To find the game UUAID, go to the Kahoot game page and copy the sequence at the end of the link. 

Doesn't work if the Kahoot is private. SHOULD work if the answers are randomized.
More updates soon! (Faster)
